# The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need - resolutions

Following [The Primeagen](https://twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen)'s course on Algorithms in [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/big-o-time-complexity/)

Trying to make all of the algorithms he made a test for, at least passing those tests, not really following the exacts days.

If you find any correction to make, please contact me or pr.
